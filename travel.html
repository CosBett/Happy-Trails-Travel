                   <img src="images/Maasai Mara.jpg" alt="A photo of Maasai Mara">
                        <p> Maasai Mara National Reserve (also "Masai Mara") is one of Africa's most magnificent game reserves. Bordering Tanzania, the Mara is the northern extension of the Serengeti and forms a wildlife corridor between the two countries.
                        It's named after the statuesque, red-cloaked Maasai people who live in the park and graze their animals here, as they have done for centuries. In their language, Mara means "mottled," perhaps a reference to the play of light and shadow from the acacia trees and cloud-studded skies on the vast grasslands.</p>

                    <img src="images/Amboseli.jpg" alt="A photo of Amboseli">
                        <p>Crowned by Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, Amboseli National Reserve is one of Kenya's most popular tourist parks. The name "Amboseli" comes from a Maasai word meaning "salty dust," an apt description for the park's parched conditions.
                        The reserve is one of the best places in Africa to view large herds of elephants up close. Other wildlife commonly spotted in the park includes big cats, such as lion and cheetah, as well as giraffe, impala, eland, waterbuck, gazelle, and more than 600 species of birds.
                        Nature lovers can explore five different habitats here, ranging from the dried-up bed of Lake Amboseli, wetlands with sulfur springs, savannah, and woodlands. Look for the local Maasai people who live in the area around the park.</p>

            <li><h2>Lake Nakuru National Park</h2></li>
                    <img src="images/nakuru.jpg" alt="A photo of Lake Nakuru">
                       <p>Lake Nakuru National Park, in Central Kenya, is famous for its huge flocks of pink flamingos. The birds throng on Lake Nakuru itself, one of the Rift Valley soda lakes that covers almost a third of the park's area.
                        The park was established in 1961, and more than 450 species of birds have been recorded here, as well as a rich diversity of other wildlife. Lions, leopards, warthogs, waterbucks, pythons, and white rhinos are just some of the animals you might see, and the landscapes range from sweeping grasslands bordering the lake to rocky cliffs and woodland.
                        The park also protects the largest euphorbia candelabrum forest in Africa. These tall, branching succulents are endemic to the region and provide a bold textural element to the arid landscapes.</p>

            <li><h2 class="popular">Nairobi</h2></li>
                    <img src="images/Nairobi.jpg" alt="A photo of Nairobi City"> 
                        <p> If you're looking for things to do in Kenya other than a safari, you'll have plenty of choices in the country's capital and largest city. Nairobi is legendary for its colorful colonial history. It was once the capital of British East Africa, luring settlers who came here to stake their fortune in the coffee and tea industries. Today, you can explore the city's famous historic sites and excellent wildlife-related attractions.
                        Craving some cultural attractions in Kenya? You'll find several worthwhile places to visit in Nairobi. The Nairobi National Museum is a great one-stop spot to see exhibits on Kenya's history, nature, culture, and contemporary art. Green thumbs will also enjoy the botanic gardens on the grounds.
                        Another popular tourist attraction is the Karen Blixen Museum, the restored residence of the famous Danish author of the book Out of Africa, also known by her pen name, Isak Dinesen.
                        To see wildlife without venturing far from the city center, visit Nairobi National Park, now a black rhino sanctuary and also home to a diversity of other African wildlife.</p>

            <li><h2 class="popular">Lamu</h2></li>
                    <img src="images/Lamu.jpg" alt="A photo of Lamu Island">
                       <p>The small island of Lamu, northeast of Mombasa, oozes old-world charm. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lamu Old Town is Kenya's oldest continually inhabited settlement, with origins dating back to the 12th century
                        Strolling the labyrinthine streets is one of the top things to do here. You can see the island's rich trading history reflected in the buildings. Architectural features from the Arab world, Europe, and India are evident, yet with a discernible Swahili technique. Intricately carved wooden doors, coral stone buildings, hidden courtyards, verandas, and rooftop patios are common features.
                        Sightseeing here is like stepping back in time. Dhows plow the harbor, few if any motorized vehicles exist here, and donkeys still rule the streets as they have done for centuries. Most of Lamu's population is Muslim, and both men and women dress in traditional attire.             
                        Top attractions on the island include Lamu Museum, with displays on Swahili culture and the region's nautical history; Lamu Fort; and the Donkey Sanctuary.
                        If all the history is a little too much, you can bask on one of the island's white-sand beaches or sip Arabic coffee in a local caf√©.</p>

            <li><h2 class="popular">Mombasa</h2></li>
                    <img src="images/Mombasa.jpg" alt=" A photo of Mombasa"> 
                       <p>Mombasa is a multicultural tourist magnet. It's also Kenya's second largest city and biggest port. British, Portuguese, Arab, Indian, and Asian immigrants add to the rich cultural mix, and their influence is evident in the architecture, as well as the many different types of cuisine.
                        Mombasa is actually an island connected to its mushrooming development on the mainland by a causeway, bridges, and ferries. Coral reefs fringe the coast for 480 kilometers, providing fantastic snorkeling and diving opportunities, especially at Mombasa Marine National Park and around Wasini Island. Dolphin watching and deep-sea fishing are also popular things to do in Mombasa.
                        You'll find plenty of tourist attractions along the Kenyan coast here. History buffs will enjoy exploring the 16th-century Fort Jesus and Old Town with its narrow streets, ancient Swahili dwellings, markets, and souvenir shops.
                        Other Mombasa tourist attractions cram the city's north shore, including Mombasa Go-Kart, cinemas, sports, and a cornucopia of restaurants.
                        This being a coastal hub, beach lovers will find some worthy strands nearby. North of the city, Nyali and Bamburi Beaches are favorites, while the white strands of Shelly, Tiwi, and Diani Beaches are popular spots south of Mombasa.</p>
